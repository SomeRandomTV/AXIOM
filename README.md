A.R.A. (Adaptive Real-Time Assistant) is an intelligent assistant designed to support caretakers \
of individuals with developmental disabilities (DD) in state group homes(residents).

Built with real-time adaptability and smart decision support in mind, ARA helps streamline daily routines, monitor behaviors(for **strong** deviations), \
and improve care through AI-driven insights.

## Features
- Real-Time Support: Responds to user input and adapts to ongoing events during care routines.

- Schedule Integration: Syncs with Google Calendar for appointment reminders, medication schedules, and task tracking.

- Behavior Tracking: Logs and analyzes patterns in behavior to support more informed caregiving.

- AI-Powered Insights: Uses machine learning to detect trends and recommend adjustments to care plans.

- Secure & Private: Designed with privacy in mind, no personal data will be sent over to the cloud for processing. All data is processed locally.

- Automated Documentation: Documents actions/behaviors/events of a resident (all in accordance with NM DOH and HIPAA)
